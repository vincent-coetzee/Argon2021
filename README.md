# Argon
Compiler for the Argon Language

Argon is a modern object based language that sorts both object based and value based entities. Argon supports multiple inheritance of object based entities, value based entities do not support multiple inheritance. Argon also supports multimethods and predicate based dispatch. Argon is a modular language with the Module being the unit of reuse and inheritance.

Modules are first class objects in Argon and may be infinitely nested to allow for a tidy mechanism of ringfencing behaviour, state and inheritance. Modules are also conatiners of states and slots can be attached to modules in either a local or a non local way. The term "local" is used to define slots that have local scope and which are lexically scoped.
